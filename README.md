# customer-lifecycle-retention-cohort-analysis-sql-powerbi
Cohort-based customer lifecycle and retention analysis (MySQL + Power BI) identifying early-stage churn drivers and revenue concentration in an e-commerce business.
**Business Context**

An e-commerce business wanted to understand how customer behaviour evolves after first purchase and where retention loss is occurring.
The goal was to determine whether growth challenges are driven by weak customer value or weak lifecycle retention.

This project analyzes customer cohorts from January 2023 to March 2024 (~17,000 transactions, ~5,000 customers).
